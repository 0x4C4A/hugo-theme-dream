All of [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) files placed in the `i18n` folder.

Now, the dream theme has these languages' translations:

* en
* zh

You can replace the translation of strings by yourself.

**Welcome PRs to add new translations!**

View [hugo doc (Translation of Strings)](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#translation-of-strings) for more details.
